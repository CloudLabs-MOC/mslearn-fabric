# Get Started with Data Warehouses and Ingesting Data with Dataflows Gen2 with Microsoft Fabric

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, you'll explore key components of Microsoft Fabric's data solution. First, you'll create and use Dataflows (Gen2) to ingest, transform, and standardize data from various sources, preparing it for analysis and landing it in a Lakehouse. Next, you'll analyze the processed data within a relational data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric, leveraging its SQL capabilities for querying and visualization.

## Objective

Explore dataflows, data warehousing, and reporting in Microsoft Fabric. By the end of this lab, You will gain insights on :

- **Create and use a Dataflow (Gen2) in Microsoft Fabric** : Learn to effectively ingest and transform data using Dataflows (Gen2) in Microsoft Fabric. Connect data sources, standardize the data, and efficiently load it to Lakehouse.
- **Analyze data in a Data Warehouse** : Learn to create and manage a relational data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric. Utilize SQL to perform queries and visualizations.

## Pre-requisites

Participants should have:

- Fundamental knowledge on Microsoft Fabric
- Basic understanding of Data Analytics

## Architecture

This lab begins with setting up a workspace and a Lakehouse in the Data Engineering area. Next, Dataflows (Gen2) are created to import and configure data sources. These dataflows are then integrated into a pipeline for additional processing. Then  Data Warehouse is created, where tables are created and structured. Following this, data is queried and views are created for further analysis. Finally, visual queries are developed to enable data visualization and provide insights.
